BIGHIT MUSIC is proud to announce today that the members of **BTS** are currently moving forward with plans to fulfill their military service.  

After the phenomenal concert to support Busan’s bid for the **World Expo 2030**, and as each individual embarks on solo endeavors, it’s the perfect time, and the members of BTS are honored to serve.

Since the creation of BTS over ten years ago, the band has:
- Risen to **international success**
- Broken **records**
- Catapulted **K-Pop** into the global stratosphere

BIGHIT MUSIC has focused on the milestone moment when it would be possible to:
- Respect the **needs of the country**
- Allow these **healthy young men** to serve with their countrymen  

That time is **now**.

### **Jin's Enlistment**
- **Jin** will initiate the process as soon as his schedule for his **solo release** concludes at the end of **October**.
- He will then follow the **enlistment procedure** of the Korean government.  

Other members of the group plan to carry out their military service based on their own **individual plans**.

### **Future Plans**
Both the company and the members of BTS are looking forward to reconvening as a group again around **2025** following their service commitment.

With the release of their first anthology album earlier this year, the path was opened for the members to:
- Take time to explore **individual projects**  

As part of the **HYBE family**, we support and encourage our artists and are beyond proud that they will each:
- Have time to explore their **unique interests**
- Do their duty by being of **service** to the country they call home

### **A Promise for the Future**
*"Yet To Come (The Most Beautiful Moment)”* is more than a track from their latest album—it is a **promise**.  

There’s much more **yet to come** in the years ahead from **BTS**.
